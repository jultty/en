# en

en is a tool to write non-linear, connected pieces of text and have their references mapped out as a graph of connected information.

It works by ingesting a TOML file containing your node specification and serving it as a website that allows nodes to be browsed, searched and listed in relation to each other or as a shallow tree of nodes.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Automatic anchors
- [x] Array syntax for lightweight connections
- [x] Automatic IDs
- [x] Automatic titles
- [x] Mismatch between TOML ID and provided ID

## Motivation

I created en because I wanted to write a complex, long-form register of my personal worldview. I have always written a lot, but I find non-fiction essays hard to carry to fruition in the usual, linear structure which you'd commonly find in, for instance, a typical philosohpy book.

I call en a "writing instrument" because that's how I relate to it. I use it to write my thoughts and connect them. I like how you can write new pages easily from a single big file so that creating new pages and connecting them is efortless compared to creating a new file for each one and them handling that spread of files. With en, I can just write a few lines and I already have a new page laid out. It fits how my thoughts also spread and fork very quickly.
