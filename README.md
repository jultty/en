en is a tool to write non-linear, connected pieces of text and have their references mapped out as a graph of connected information.

It works by ingesting a TOML file containing your node specification and serving it as a website that allows nodes to be browsed, searched and listed in relation to each other or as a shallow tree of nodes.
